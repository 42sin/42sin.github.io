  Hey, my name's Ersin and I'm a Junior Software Developer with a passion for back-end development.
  At 22, I recently completed the Core Curriculum at [42 Heilbronn](https://www.42heilbronn.de), showing my commitment to continous learning and growth in this field.

  My primary expertise lies in <mark>C/C++</mark>, but I've also delved into diverse technologies such as:

  <mark>JavaScript</mark>,<mark>NestJS</mark>,<mark>AngularJS</mark>,<mark>Docker</mark>,<mark>Docker</mark>,<mark>Bash</mark> and system administration in general.

  Through these experiences, I've honed my technological skills and am now ready for the exciting challenges the business world has to offer.

          The first group project during my time at 42, as well as the first huge project that we had to handle. This was by far my favourite project during the curriculum and the one that teached me the most.

          This was one of the first big projects in C++. It gave me an opportunity to enhance my skills in object-oriented programming, C++ and things about networking/server in general.

          The second group project and the last project that was in pure C. It allowed me to work with an extern library for the first time, teached me more about algorithms and how mathematics can help when working with graphical projects.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
